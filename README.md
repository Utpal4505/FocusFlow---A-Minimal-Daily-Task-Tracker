# ☀️ FocusFlow – My Simple Daily Task Tracker 🧠

This is a basic task app I built just to practice DOM stuff in JavaScript.  
I was learning things like `createElement`, `event.target`, `classList`, `localStorage`, etc. — so I thought let me build a simple to-do type project where I can try all this.

No fancy UI or frameworks — just plain HTML, CSS, JS.

## 🔧 What It Can Do

- Add a task
- Mark it as complete (line-through style)
- Delete a task
- Save everything in localStorage (so it stays after refresh)

---

## 🎯 What I Actually Learned

- How to create elements using `createElement()` and set text with `textContent`
- How to use `classList.add()` and `remove()` to toggle styles
- How `event.target` helps figure out what was clicked
- How to use `localStorage.setItem` and `getItem` to save data

---

## ❓ What Confused Me at First

- How to remove tasks from both the DOM **and** localStorage together
- Figuring out which button was clicked using `event.target`
- Remembering that localStorage stores only strings (so need to use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`)

## 📁 Project Structure

FocusFlow/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file – structure of the app
├── style.css         # All the basic styling – layout, fonts, colors
└── script.js         # Main logic – handles adding, completing, deleting tasks & localStorage

## 💡 Why I Made This

Not to build some big app, but to **practice properly**.  
This helped me:
- Think through logic myself (no copying)
- Understand how each part works together
- Make mistakes and fix them — that’s where I really learned
